<p>
    If a sector or organisation doesn't advertise formal placements, then you might need to be a 
    bit more creative when searching for opportunities in these areas.

    <h3> Top Tip! <img src="Images/bulb.png" style="float:left;width:40px;height:40px;"> </h3> 
    </div><br>
    Start by compiling a list of 
    organisations which you are interested in and contact each to see if they would consider you a placement student. 
</div>

<p>There are lots of different ways to approach organisations, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>telephone calls (great for a quick answer) </li>
    <li>sending a CV and covering letter</li>
    <li>in-person</li>
    <li>through LinkedIn or via your own networks (e.g. identifying possible organisations through friends and family contacts). </li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider more than your existing personal networks. Peers on courses and staff within schools 
    may also have contacts within their networks which may be of use. 
    The Leeds Network is a great way to contact University of Leeds alumni who might be able to give advice too.  </p>

        I secured a placement with Starbucks in the USA just from speculatively approaching them. 
        I believe four factors combined enabled her to create a positive first impression and helped me secure the placement: 
        <ol> 
            <li>I approached the organisation well in advance</li>
            <li>I remained persistent</li>
            <li> I did lots of research on the organisation</li>
            <li>I was clear about the role I wanted to undertake</li> 
        </ol>
</div>

<p>When searching for placements speculatively, there are a few things to consider. Click on each item to learn more!
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Length of Placement</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Be flexible as for some organisations a shorter duration may be 
      better whereas others may need a longer term commitment (remember to check the schoolâ€™s minimum requirements) </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pay</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Think about this carefully when approaching an organisation. Think about how you will fund the placement year 
      and state in your application that you are looking for a paid placement. 
      If you do accept an unpaid placement, ask if they are able to cover daily travel expenses. </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Job Description and Contract</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Even if an organisation creates a placement for the student, you will still need to have a 
      job description and a contract so both parties have clear expectations of the work that will be done during the placement 
      as well as other conditions such as working hours and holiday entitlement. 
      You also need to give a copy of the job description to their school placement contact as part of the 
      placement approval process.  </p>
